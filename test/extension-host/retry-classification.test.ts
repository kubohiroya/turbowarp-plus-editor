/**
 * What the authoring path actually fails with, and what the Loader says about asking again.
 *
 * The retry affordance (kubohiroya/turbowarp-plus-editor#88) is only allowed to ask one question —
 * `isWorthAskingAgain(error)` — because the first attempt at it wrote a table of 29 error codes
 * into the host and had to be removed (kubohiroya/scratch-gui#108). This pins the answer for every
 * failure the library's own path can produce, so the screen that grows a button can rely on the
 * judgement instead of reading codes.
 *
 * `LOAD_FAILED` appears twice below with opposite answers: an offline fetch and a registration that
 * declared the wrong ID both carry it, and only the first is worth asking about. That is the case
 * that makes branching on the code wrong.
